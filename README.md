Exploration w=using Newton's method in the complex plane

Newton's formula estimates the root of a function by taking a predetermined value approximate to the root and determining a value closer to the actual root by solving the equation of the tangent to the previous estimate. This process is iterated which provides increasing accuracy, under conditions that the curve is continuous and does not have abrupt changes in velocity, is written as the equation 
	                                    xn+1 = xn â€“ f(n)/f'(n).
Using this equation the roots form z3-1 can be determined. If done using complex numbers both the real and imaginary roots can be found. Using newtons formula we can determine the roots with the equation 
	                                    zi+1 = (2/3)*zi + 1/(3zi2)
